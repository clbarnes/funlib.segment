    """Label connected components in the given graph.

    By default, connectivitiy is induced by the existence of edges.

    If ``edge_attribute`` is not ``None``, the given edge attribute and
    relation will be used to infer connectivity: if the edge attribute is
    smaller (or larger) than the given ``threshold``, the incident nodes are
    considered connected. E.g., if the edge attritute is ``score``, the
    relation ``<=`` and the threshold ``0.5``, every edge with
    ``graph.edges[e]["score"] <= 0.5`` will be considered for connectivity.

    Arguments:

        graph (``networkx``-compatible graph):

            The graph to find connected components in.

        node_component_attribute (``string``, optional):

            If given, the component number will be written to that node
            attribute.

        edge_score_attribute (``string``, optional):

            Which edge attribute to use to determine connectivity. If not
            given, connectivity is induced by the existence of edges.

        edge_score_relation (``string``, optional):

            Any of ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, ``>=``.

        edge_score_threshold (``float``, optional):

            Which threshold to use on ``edge_score_attribute`` to determine
            connectivity.

        return_lut (``bool``, optional):

            Return a look-up table from nodes to components.
